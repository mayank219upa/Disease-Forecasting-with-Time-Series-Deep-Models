# 🦠 Predicting Disease Outbreaks Using Time Series Analysis and Classification

## Overview
[cite_start]This project focuses on predicting disease outbreaks [cite: 1][cite_start], with a particular emphasis on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a case study[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The methodologies are adaptable to other infectious diseases, making this a versatile tool in global health crisis management[cite: 4].

## 💡 Abstract
[cite_start]We developed predictive models to classify countries into **low, moderate, and high-risk categories** based on their healthcare infrastructure and socio-economic metrics, using machine learning algorithms[cite: 3].

[cite_start]We utilized time-series analysis techniques such as **ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM** [cite: 2][cite_start], alongside classification methods including **decision trees, random forests, and neural networks** to forecast and categorize outbreak risks[cite: 2].

[cite_start]The models were able to effectively predict and classify the risk levels of different countries, assisting in strategic planning for healthcare resource allocation[cite: 9].

## 📊 Data Collection
The primary datasets include:

* [cite_start]**Outbreak Data:** Information from WHO's Disease Outbreak News and the Coronavirus Dashboard[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Medical Parameter Data:** Data from various sources including Statista, covering hospital bed density, ICU availability, health expenditure, and more[cite: 6].

## 🚀 Usage
To execute the analysis, run the main Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Disease Prediction.ipynb
````
