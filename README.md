# 🦠 Predicting Disease Outbreaks Using Time Series Analysis and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting disease outbreaks, with a particular emphasis on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a case study.
The methodologies are adaptable to other infectious diseases, making this a versatile tool in global health crisis management.

## 💡 Abstract
We developed predictive models to classify countries into **low, moderate, and high-risk categories** based on their healthcare infrastructure and socio-economic metrics, using machine learning algorithms.

We utilized time-series analysis techniques such as **ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM** , alongside classification methods including **decision trees, random forests, and neural networks** to forecast and categorize outbreak risks.

[cite_start]The models were able to effectively predict and classify the risk levels of different countries, assisting in strategic planning for healthcare resource allocation[cite: 9].
